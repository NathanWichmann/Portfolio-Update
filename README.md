# Portfolio-Update

# Deployed Link <a href="https://nathanwichmann.github.io/Portfolio-Update/">Portfolio</a>
This repository (Personal Portfolio) is an educational homework assignment from CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C coding boot-camp. It combines our knowledge of 
html5 and CSS3 together to create a personal portfolio that we can use through-out the course and after we graduate to show potential employers what we have 
accomplished. 

# Assignment
This assignment was designed for the class to demonstrate our work to a potential hiring manager. Although, this website is simplistic in nature, it does show how far the journey has been, through the deployed work. In the bebining of the course, it took all my effort just to make this site and understand the terminology. That has changed, what once took me hours to change on this site, now takes a matter of minutes and I was even able to clean up the code from the begining of the course. 

# Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br>

# Updated Acceptance Criteria 
Submit an updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.<br>
Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.<br>
Submit an updated resume<br>
Submit an updated LinkedIn profile<br>

# Installation 
Making the website was so much fun. I decided not to use the exact make-up of the portfolio offered as it was not that aesthetically pleasing.
I decided to be more creative and use a theme through-out the website. I used the same colors from the visual studio code, coding screen on the site. 
Since the first iteration of this assignment, I decided to add bootstrap to the coding. Bootstrap allows for easier grid work and better layout of the code.
I added some new pictures for the assignment but kept the overall feel and design of the website. I wanted it to be original and outside the normal standard 
personal biographies. I added many new features to my GitHub account. The first page has more information about me and looks more robust with pinned work added. 
I also added more information to my Linkedin page about this course and updated my resume to reflect the same. I added the languages we have learnt up to date.
