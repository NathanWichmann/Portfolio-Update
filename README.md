This repository (Personal Portfolio) is an educational homework assignment from CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C coding boot-camp. It combines our knowledge of 
html5 and CSS together to create a personal portfolio that we can use through-out the course and after we graduate to show potential employers what we have 
accomplished. 

# Assignment
This assignment was designed for the class to demonstrate our work to a potential hiring manager. Being that this is the beginning of the course, there are only a couple 
projects added. There will be many more added through-out the course.

# Acceptance Criteria 
<copied from the homework assignment directly>
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work&nbsp;
WHEN I load their portfolio&nbsp;
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

# Installation 
Making the website was so much fun. I decided not to use the exact make-up of the portfolio offered as it was not that aesthetically pleasing.
I decided to be more creative and use a theme through-out the website. I used the same colors from the visual studio code, coding screen on the site. 
I remembered the <span> element used in the first homework assignment and decided to use it here. I used it to change the colors of my name on 
top of the screen. I decided to add a picture of just how I feel doing this course, outside my comfort zone. There is a picture of myself and all links work. 

# What I Learnt 
This time around I was able to add many more features to the website. I took advantage of the grid code on the bootstrap website which made the appearence even more pleasing to the eye. I was able to update the overall effectivness of the website by having everything in their appropriate sections, instead of in a line down the left hand side. The overall process of making and designing a website is so much faster and more effient when tools such as Bootstrap are introduced.
